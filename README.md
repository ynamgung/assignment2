# Assignment2

Instructions for Assignment 2


## Overview

One page responsive sign up form. Using only HTML and CSS, create a one page site that will contain a form and other semantic elements as you see fit.

Javascript will not be required for this assignment.

No frameworks are to be used. (bootstrap, foundation, etc.). No copying and pasting either.

## Specifics

**1. Create your own file tree.**
 - include directories for CSS and Images (if any)
 - don't forget the `index.html` at the root
 
**2. HTML - your page should include the following**
 - a semantic form with all the required attributes
 - this form will not submit anything, so if it tries to submit, it will just refresh the page
 - header element with mock nav items (that won't go anywhere)
 - footer element with mock links and copyright info
   - the mock links can be for whatever, social media, nothing, goodle, etc
   
**3. CSS**
 - no in document or inline styles, only a, external file that will be called in your `<head>` element
 - while I'm not looking for the next great beautiful project, it should look good
 - to achieve the responsive aspect, you will need to leverage `media queries`, `flex` display and other techniques as needed
 - layout should change in some way when switching viewports (doesn't have to be drastic)

***when making the pull request, make sure you include your name and class somewhere in it***
